<h2>Friends &amp; Family Registration &mdash; &pound;75<abbr title="plus Value Added Tax">+VAT</abbr></h2>

<p>Last year's event was a sell-out success. So much so, many of our nearest and dearest couldn't get hold of tickets. But don't be alarmed. If you're reading this page, we have good news for you.</p>

<p>We've hand picked a select group of people for early registration, and you're one of them. So simply click the register button, fill in your details and jump to the head of the queue.</p>
<?php 
include "../includes/modules/register/index.php";

?>

<p>We know you're a social bunch, so once you're done, feel free to come back to this page to register a friend. Just bear in mind that there are only a limited number of friends &amp; family places, so don't invite your whole department. Otherwise you may end up taking Jon Hicks's seat, and we wouldn't want that now, would we?</p>
