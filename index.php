<h3>All Over Bar the Podcasting
<span class="newsdate">12th Sep</span></h3>

<p>So d.Construct 2006 is officially over, and what a fantastic event it was. We had some amazing <a href="http://2006.dconstruct.org/speakers">speakers</a> talking about a range of fascinating <a href="http://2006.dconstruct.org/schedule">subjects</a>. We had a room full of passionate <a href="http://dconstruct06.madgex.com/people/">developers</a> posting their pictures to <a href="http://www.flickr.com/groups/dconstruct06/pool/">Flickr</a>, <a href="http://dconstruct06.madgex.com/feeds/">blogging</a> the event and generally having a good time.</p>

<p>Sunny Brighton was on top form and lunch saw everything from fish and chips on the pier to a <a href="http://microformats.org/wiki/events/2006-09-08-brighton-microformats-picnic">microformats picnic</a> in the Pavilion Gardens. There were prizes galore, including stacks of books from <a href="http://friendsofed.com/bloggED/?p=34">FriendsofED</a>, tickets to <a href="http://2007.sxsw.com/interactive/">SXSWi</a> and a Video iPod courtesy of <a href="http://uk.answers.yahoo.com/">Yahoo! Answers</a>. A fantastic goodie bag complete with a t-shirt, copy of .Net and Yahoo! branded water meant nobody went away empty handed.</p>

<p>To top it all off we had a couple of memorable parties that went late into the night and even a <a href="http://blog.snipperoo.com/2006/09/jays_dconstruct.html">crazy golf tournament</a>. What more could you ask for?</p>

<p>Of course the conference wasn't without its hiccups, including slightly cramped seats and patchy WiFi in the morning. However that all helped add to the grassroots charm.</p>

<p>We'll be adding links to all the <a href="http://2006.dconstruct.org/schedule">presentations</a> as we get them, and we'll be releasing each session as a <a href="http://2006.dconstruct.org/podcast">podcast</a> over the coming weeks.</p>

<p>Overall we had a fantastic time at d.Construct and hope you did too. We'd like to thank all the speakers, sponsors and volunteers for making the conference possible. Most importantly, we'd like to thank you for making d.Construct 2006 such a memorable event.</p>

<p>We look forward to seeing you at d.Construct 2007.</p>
